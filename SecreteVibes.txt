After surviving a traumatic background, I was mentally affected and it is hard for me to cop up with life.
I try my very best to move on, but time to time memories keep haunting me. When I was young, I tought it would 
go as I grow older. However, the more I try to move past these demons, the scarier my nights get. I appreciate life
and I would never want to take it away, but sometimes it seems like the only option is to go away. I hope in this space
I find people of my kind to help me survive and live a fulfilling life.
I am a live
